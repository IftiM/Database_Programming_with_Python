# Database_Programming_with_Python
A simple application for Customer Helpdesk Team, utilizing CRUD, ETL and OOP

Platform and drivers in use:
SQL Server, Python, PYODBC, Jupyter Notebook

A databse with multiple tables were created in SQL Server. Python 
was used with the help of PYODBC driver to retrieve the data from
the tables. This application can be used to add, view, query, and 
edit data. Delete data wasn't initiated since all the customer issues
were to save, rather change the status to 'closed' instead.
A graphical user interface (GUI) was created, and a log-in window
validating user credentials
